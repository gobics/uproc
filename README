General Notes

Contact
=======

Please send bug reports, suggestions or questions to uproc@gobics.de or create
an issue at `UProC on GitHub`_.

Version numbering
=================

UProC uses `semantic versioning`_. This means that the version number has the
format ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`` and an increment in one of the parts has the
following meaning:

1. ``MAJOR``: The user interface (input, output and/or command-line arguments)
   of the programs or the format of the supplementary files was changed in a
   backwards-incompatible manner.
2. ``MINOR``: Some functionality was added.
3. ``PATCH``: One or more bugs were fixed.

If ``MINOR`` or ``PATCH`` are incremented, all modifications are
backwards-compatible. See the `semantic versioning`_ homepage for details.

License
=======

The code for the UProC executables is available under the `GNU GPLv3`_ (see the
``COPYING`` file). However, most of the functionality is separated into a
library called `libuproc`, using the `GNU LGPLv3`_ (see the ``COPYING.LESSER``
file).

Installation
============

Obtaining UProC
===============

Please visit the `UProC downloads`_ page to make sure you're using the latest
release. If you are interested in contributing, please get a clone of `UProC on
GitHub`_ and base your work off the ``devel`` branch.

.. _`UProC downloads`: http://uproc.gobics.de/downloads.html


Binary packages
===============

We currently offer binary packages for Windows XP and later, for 32 bit (i686)
and 64 bit (x86-64, also known as amd64) architectures. To install, just
download and extract the corresponding zip file. Currently there is no
graphical user interface, you need to run UProC from a PowerShell or
``cmd.exe``.

Please note that UProC is primarily developed for (and works best on) unix
systems.



Installation from source package
================================

UProC uses the `GNU Autotools`_, so installation should work on any system that
has a POSIX compatible ``/bin/sh``, ``make`` and a C99 compiler.

For additional features, UProC has the following **optional** dependencies:

zlib (highly recommended)
    Used for On-the-fly ``gzip`` (de-)compression of files. This is probably
    already installed on your computer, but you need to make sure that the
    development headers are also available.

OpenMP
    UProC uses OpenMP for parallelization, if the compiler suports it. The
    configure script automatically detects whether this is the case.

Doxygen (for developers, version 1.8.0 or later recommended)
    If Doxygen is available, it wil be used to generate the the API
    documentation of `libuproc` (which is also available at the `UPRoC
    homepage`_.


.. _`GNU Autotools`: http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual
.. _`UProC homepage`: http://uproc.gobics.de


To install UProC from a source tarball, simply extract it and run the
commands ::

        ./configure
        make
        make install  # requires appropriate privileges in PREFIX (see below)

By default, the executables are built in a way that you can omit the ``make
install`` step and just run them from wherever you wish or copy them to a
desired location (it is recommended to utilize the ``--prefix`` option
mentioned below, though).

You can pass the following options (and more) to the ``configure`` script:

--prefix=PREFIX     Install all files below ``PREFIX`` (see the `Installation
                    Names` section the ``INSTALL`` file for details).

--disable-openmp    Do not use OpenMP (i.e. disable multi-threading). This will
                    usually cause longer running times. You probably don't want
                    this.

--disable-shared    Link all execututables statically and do not build and
                    install `libuproc` as a shared library.

See the ``INSTALL`` file for a more detailed description of the installation
process for projects using `GNU Autotools`_.


Installation from Git
=====================

On a fresh clone of the git repo, run ``autoreconf -i`` to generate the
``configure`` script and then follow the instructions in the previous section.


===================
Supplementary files
===================

UProC needs certain files at runtime. These files are split into two
categories, usually available as two distinct directories in the file system.


Database
========

The database consists of files representing a set of known protein subsequences
that map to given families, e.g. extracted from PFAM.

There are two ways to obtain a database:

1.  You can download a database from the `UProC downloads`_ page and import it
    with the ``uproc-import`` program.
2.  Alternatively, you can create your own database with the ``uproc-makedb``
    program.

Detailed instructions for these programs can be found by passing the ``-h``
option when running them.


Model
=====

The model consists of files containing certain parameters that are not tied to
a particular database. You can download the newest model files at `UProC
downloads`_.


=============
Running UProC
=============

UProC consists of the following command-line programs:

``uproc-prot``
    Protein sequence classifier.

``uproc-dna``
    DNA/RNA sequence classifier.

``uproc-orf``
    Command-line interface to the ORF translation mechanism used by
    ``uproc-dna``.

``uproc-import``
    Import database.

``uproc-export``
    Export database.

``uproc-makedb``
    Create a new database.

You can pass the ``-h`` option to find out how they are used.
